Welcome to the Legends of WAT. This application is a site that I wrote for my own personal amusement.
The idea is to collect funny, interesting, or purely outrageous snippets of code for the world to see.
Inspired by the WAT Lightening Talk, and developed in Node.js, my hope is that the submissions to this
app will be amusing and what you learn from peeking at the code will be enlightening.

## Getting Started

This app was built on Express running on Node.js 0.6. Additioanlly, stylesheets are compiled using
compass and Twitter's Bootstrap template - so you'll be required to install the requisite rubygems
for those as well.

I believe these two commands should get you squared away with compass:

```
$ gem install compass
$ gem install compass_twitter_bootstrap
```

Then, you should just need to have npm install the project dependancies.

```
$ npm install -d
```

After that, you should be able to run the project in development mode by invoking jake.

```
$ jake
```
